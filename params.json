  "body": "### Welcome to RackMaker.\r\nRackMaker is designed to make the lives of network engineers, server engineers, system engineers, network technicians, server technicians and interns of all walks easier.  Ditch the Visio, Auto-Cad or other propriety file type for rack drawing creation and enjoy the beauty of LaTeX generated PDF's.\r\n\r\n### Best Practice\r\nThis software is best used on an Ubuntu 16.04.02 running Appache2, gcc version 5.4.0, and texlive-full.  It is not intended for use on evil windows machines.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn June of 2015 Aaron Skarlupka (@aaronSkar) created RackMaker to avoid using MS Visio to make rack drawings as a Network Engineering Intern.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble using RackMaker? Go to the github page and report an issue.  \r\n",
